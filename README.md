EHR Summarization Assistant Using Azure Databricks and OpenAI I will simulate patient records and create a generative AI workflow to summarize patient history using a large language model. This is a great practice for the exam, and covers data engineering, prompt engineering, code, and deployment basics.
A hands-on project simulating patient Electronic Health Records and building a Generative AI workflow for summarizing patient visit notes. Designed for GenAI Engineer Associate exam prep, this project demonstrates data loading, prompt engineering, API integration, and basic deployment—all using Azure Databricks.



EHR Summarization Assistant with Azure Databricks & Generative AI
A hands-on project simulating patient Electronic Health Records and building a Generative AI workflow for summarizing patient visit notes. Designed for GenAI Engineer Associate exam prep, this project demonstrates data loading, prompt engineering, API integration, and basic deployment—all using Azure Databricks.

**Project Overview**

This repository showcases how to use Azure Databricks and a Large Language Model (LLM) to create an assistant that summarizes electronic health record visit notes.

Synthetic EHR data is generated in Python.
Generative AI (OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI) powers text summarization.
Deployment via Databricks serving endpoint.


**Learning Objectives**

Practice Databricks environment setup on Azure.
Load, engineer, and visualize synthetic health data.
Leverage generative AI APIs to summarize clinical notes.
Build and deploy your summarizer as a service endpoint.
Gain hands-on experience with GenAI workflows.


**Project Structure**

Markdown

├── EHR_Summarization_Assistant.ipynb  # Main Databricks notebook
├── summarizer.py                      # Summarization function for model serving
├── README.md                          # This documentation
└── ehr_records.csv                    # Synthetic patient data (generated by notebook)


**Getting Started**

1. Setup Azure Databricks

[ ] Create an Azure Databricks workspace.
[ ] Start a compute cluster and upload this repository’s files or copy code snippets.

2. Generate Synthetic EHR Data
In the notebook, run code to create and save patient records to DBFS.

3. Load Data and Explore

Read ehr_records.csv into a Pandas DataFrame
Visualize and review patient records

4. Integrate Generative AI via OpenAI API

Install openai Python library in your notebook
Configure your API Key (openai.api_key)
Use the summarization function to produce text summaries for clinical notes

5. Model Deployment (Optional Advanced)

Register summarization function as a Databricks model
Set up a Databricks serving endpoint
Test endpoint with input payloads


**Requirements**

Azure Databricks workspace access
Python (Databricks Runtime)
OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key
Python libraries: pandas, openai


**How to Run**

Clone or download this repository.
Upload EHR_Summarization_Assistant.ipynb to your Databricks workspace.
Follow the notebook steps end-to-end.
Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable or in notebook code.
(Optional) Explore model deployment steps for real-time serving integration.


**Key Concepts & Extensions**

Synthetic Data Engineering: Safely practice clinical workflows without PHI
Prompt Engineering: Experiment with LLMs for healthcare summaries
Databricks Model Serving: Prototype AI-powered healthcare endpoints
Exam Skills: Data handling, API integration, prompt design, model lifecycle basics
